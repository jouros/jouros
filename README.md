Hi, I’m @jouros, Linux and Open Source geek with over 22 years experience with Open Source systems.  

I have worked with all major linux variants and done almost anything with linux, I installed my first linux in 1998 and I'm still on that road :)  

Alongside with linux I have done professional penetration testing services since 90's and of course with Open Source tools. 

Since 2003 I've been working in my own company JRComplex as idependent consultant. Since 2018 I've been working with Kubernetes and DevOps.
